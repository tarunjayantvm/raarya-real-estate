Project Setup Instructions for Raarya Website

1. Install Node.js and npm
- Download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from https://nodejs.org/
- To verify installation, open a terminal and run:
  node -v
  npm -v
- You should see version numbers for both.

2. Get the Project Folder
- Obtain the full project folder (not just some files) by:
  - Downloading and extracting a ZIP
  - Cloning from GitHub (if available)
  - Copying from a USB drive, etc.

3. Install Project Dependencies
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder (where package.json is located):
  cd path/to/project-folder
- Run:
  npm install
- This will install all required packages.

4. Start the Project
- In the terminal, run:
  npm run dev
- Or, if that doesn't work, try:
  npm start
- The correct command is usually in the scripts section of package.json.

5. Open the Project in Your Browser
- After starting, the terminal will show a local address (e.g., http://localhost:5173). Open this in your browser.

6. Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing packages, run npm install again.
- If you see errors about missing files or folders, make sure you are in the correct project directory.
